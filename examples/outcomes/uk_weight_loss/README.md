[`uk_weight_loss_insights_data.xlsx`](uk_weight_loss_insights_data.xlsx) is the layer underneath: one tab per theme, every item that theme was built from, with its sentiment, emotion, engagement and source link.

## The headline finding

Two themes dominate what patients actually talk about, and neither is the drug itself.

| Theme | Share of patient conversation |
|---|---|
| The weekly weigh-in ritual | 21.7% |
| Dose titration and click-counting | 21.6% |

The weekly weigh-in, the plateau and the stall are the emotional centre of the experience. The
second theme is pure economics: counting clicks to stretch a pen, and titrating around what the
next dose costs.

## Themes

1. The weekly ritual: weigh-ins, plateaus and stalls
2. Dose titration and click-counting economics
3. Side effects and their management
4. Provider shopping, prices and switching
5. Eating mechanics on the medication
6. Food noise and appetite psychology
7. Body image transformations and non-scale victories
8. Stopping, maintenance and regain fear
9. Community ritual and mutual support
10. Eligibility, BMI gates and verification
11. The pill pivot: oral GLP-1s arrive
12. The business and policy layer
13. Stigma, secrecy and telling people
14. Safety, deaths, counterfeits and the grey market
15. Hair loss

## Auditability

Every number in the report traces back to the items behind it.

- **Relevance was measured, not assumed.** A 60-item random-sample audit at seed 7 found 57 of 60 on topic, the 3 misses conversational glue, zero wrong-topic items.
- **Emotion classification is auditable.** Each of the 8 Plutchik emotions is shown with real verbatims from the items scored into it, so the classification can be checked rather than trusted.
- **Query framing bias is documented as a limitation.** Search vocabulary is not conversation vocabulary, and the report says where that mattered. Seed terms came from 284 Google Trends related queries rather than intuition, and themes were still discovered inductively from the corpus rather than taken from Trends.
- **Deviations are recorded.** Two charts and the source labelling were corrected after generation, and the report says so.
